# Equalization-algorithms
Average convergence plots of various equalization algorithms.

The folder contains the MATLAB codes for Least Mean square (LMS), Normalized LMS (NLMS) and Recursive Least Square equalization
algorithms. 

The final results of the code show the average convergance plots of all the algorithms and their comparisons with respect to each
other
